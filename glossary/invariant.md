# Invariant

In computer science, a predicate that, if true, will remain true throughout a specific sequence of operations, is called (an) invariant to that sequence.

## From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics)#Invariants_in_computer_science)

> In computer science, an invariant is a logical assertion that is always held to be true during a certain phase of execution of a computer program. For example, a loop invariant is a condition that is true at the beginning and the end of every execution of a loop.
>
>Invariants are especially useful when reasoning about the correctness of a computer program. The theory of optimizing compilers, the methodology of design by contract, and formal methods for determining program correctness, all rely heavily on invariants.
>
>Programmers often use assertions in their code to make invariants explicit. Some object oriented programming languages have a special syntax for specifying class invariants.
