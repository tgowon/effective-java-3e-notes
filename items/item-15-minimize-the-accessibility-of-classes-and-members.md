# Item 15: Minimize the accessibility of classes and members

## Main Takeaway

> You should reduce accessibility of program elements as much as possible (within reason). After carefully designing a minimal public API, you should prevent any stray classes, interfaces, or members from becoming part of teh API. With the exception of `public static final` fields, which serve as constants, public classes should have no public fields. Ensure that objects referenced by `public static final` fields are immutable.
