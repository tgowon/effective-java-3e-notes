# Item 25: Limit source files to a single top-level class

## Main Takeaway

>Never put multiple top-level classes or interfaces in a single source file. Following this rule guarantees that you can't have multiple definitions for a single class at compile time. This in turn guarantees that the class files generated by compilation, and the behavior of the resulting program, are independent of the order in which the source files are passed to the compiler.

## Alternatives

### Split into multiple top-level source files

_Self-explanatory._ If classes are truly independent, there is no need to have them in a single top-level class.

## Use [static member classes](./item-24-favor-static-member-classes-over-nonstatic.md)

>If the classes are subservient to another class, making them into static member classes is generally the better alternative because it enhances readability and make it possible to reduce the accessibility of the classes by declaring them [private](./item-15-minimize-the-accessibility-of-classes-and-members.md).
