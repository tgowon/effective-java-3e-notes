# Item 14: Consider Implementing `Comparable`

## Main Takeaway

> Whenever you implement a value class that has a sensible ordering, you should have the class implement the `Comparable` interface so that its instances can be easily sorted, searched, and used in comparison-based collections. When comparing field values in the implementations of the `compareTo` methods, avoid the use of the `<` and `>` operators. Instead, use the static `compare` methods in the boxed primitive classes or the comparator construction methods in the `Comparator` interface.

## Rationale

By implementing `Comparable` you allow your class to interoperate with all of the many generic algorithms and collection implementations that depend on this interface.

Classes that depend on comparison include the sorted collections `TreeSet` and `TreeMap` and the utility classes `Collections` and `Arrays` which contain searching and sorting algorithms.

Virtually all of the value classes in the Java platform libraries, as well as the enum types (Item 34) implement `Comparable`. If you are writing a value class with an obvious natural ordering, such as alphabetical order, numerical order, or chronological order, you should implement the `Comparable interface:

```java
public interface Comparable<T>{
    int compareTo(T t);
}
```

## `Comparable` - Contract Definition

>Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object. Throws `ClassCastException` if the specified object's type prevents it from being compared to this object.

Comparable is an interface defining a strategy of comparing an object with other objects of the same type. This is called the class's “natural ordering.”

### Comparable Properties

**Note:** the notation `sgn(expression)` designates the mathematical [`signum`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_function) function, which is defined to return -1, 0, or 1, according to whether the values of the `expression` is negative, zero, or positive.

#### Symmetry

>The implementer must ensure that `sgn(x.compareTo(y)) == -sgn(y.compareTo(x))` for all `x` and `y`. (This implies that `x.compareTo(y)` must throw an exception if and off iff `y.compareTo(x))` throws and exception.

#### Transitive

>The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive: `(x.compareTo(y) > 0 && y.compareTo(z)>0)` implies `x.compareTo(z)>0`.

#### Equivalence

>Finally, the implementer must ensure that `x.compareTo(y)==0` implies that `sgn(x.compareTo(z))==sgn(y.compareTo(z))`, for all `z`.

#### [Optional] Relation to `equals`

>It is strongly recommended, but not required that `(x.compareTo(y)==0)==(x.equals(y))`. Generally speaking, any class that implements the `Comparable` interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact. The recommended language is: "Note: This class has a natural ordering that is inconsistent with `equals`."

## `compareTo` and `equals`

### Similarities

Once consequence of these Comparison provisions is that the equality test imposed by a `compareTo` method must obey the same restrictions imposed by the `equals` contract: **reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.** Therefore, the same caveat applies: **there is no way to extend an instantiable class with a new value component while preserving the `compareTo` contract, unless you are willing to forgo the benefits of object-oriented abstraction** (Item 10).

The same workaround applies, too. If you want to add a value component to a class that implements `Comparable`, don't extend it: write an unrelated class containing an instance of the first class. Then provided a "view" method that returns the contained instance.

### Differences

Because the `Comparable` interface is parameterized, the `compareTo` method is statically typed, so you don't need to type check or cast its argument. If the argument is of the wrong type, the invocation won't even compile. If the argument is `null`, the invocation should throw a `NullPointerException`.

Unlike the `equals` method, which imposes a global equivalence relation on all objects, `compareTo` doesn't have to work across objects of different types: when confronted with objects of different types, `compareTo` is permitted to throw `ClassCastException`. Usually, that's exactly what it does.

## Writing a good `compareTo` method

To compare object reference fields, invoke the compareTo method recursively.
If a field does not implement `Comparable` or you need nonstandard ordering, use a Comparator instead.

With primitives, use use the static `compare` methods on all of Java's boxed primitive classes instead of relational operators `<` or `>`.

If a class has multiple significant fields, start with the most significant field, and work your way down.

If using the `Comparator` interface, be mindful that its advantage (the use of _comparator construction methods_, which enable a fluent interface) comes as a modest performance cost (for sorting arrays they generate).

## What is a `Comparator`?

The Comparator interface defines a `compare(arg1, arg2)` method with two arguments that represent compared objects, and works similarly to the Comparable.compareTo() method.

```java
public class PlayerRankingComparator implements Comparator<Player> {
    @Override
    public int compare(Player firstPlayer, Player secondPlayer) {
       return Integer.compare(firstPlayer.getRanking(), secondPlayer.getRanking());
    }
}
```

Note how this would be similar to the `Comparable` interface, but the method on `Comparable` takes a single argument:

```java
public class Player implements Comparable<Player> {
    
    //...

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Player otherPlayer) {
        return Integer.compare(getRanking(), otherPlayer.getRanking());
    }
}
```

Comparators can be passed into other sorting methods if the default (natural) ordering is not preferred:

```java
PlayerRankingComparator playerComparator = new PlayerRankingComparator();
Collections.sort(footballTeam, playerComparator);
```

## `Comparator` vs `Comparable`

(Reference: [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-comparator-comparable#comparator-vs-comparable))

The Comparable interface is a good choice to use for defining the default ordering, or in other words, if it's the main way of comparing objects.

So why use a Comparator if we already have Comparable?

There are several reasons why:

- Sometimes we can't modify the source code of the class whose objects we want to sort, thus making the use of Comparable impossible
- Using Comparators allows us to avoid adding additional code to our domain classes
- We can define multiple different comparison strategies, which isn't possible when using Comparable
